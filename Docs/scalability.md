# Scalability Considerations for Splitwise System

## Introduction

As the user base of Splitwise grows, it's essential to ensure that the system can handle increasing loads while maintaining performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency. This document explores the key scalability considerations for the Splitwise system and provides strategies to ensure that the system can scale effectively.

## Key Scalability Challenges

1. **Increased User Base**:
   - As the number of users grows, the system will need to handle a larger volume of:
     - Expense additions.
     - Balance calculations.
     - Group management operations.
     - Notification deliveries.

2. **High Read/Write Operations**:
   - With a large number of expenses and groups, the system will experience frequent read and write operations on the database, particularly for:
     - Retrieving user balances.
     - Updating expenses and group data.
     - Simplifying debts.
   
3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Users expect near real-time updates to their balances and group expenses, which means the system needs to process updates and notify users quickly.

4. **Database Growth**:
   - As more expenses are logged, the size of the database will grow, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks in queries, especially when retrieving large amounts of data.

## Scalability Strategies

### 1. **Database Scaling**

   #### a. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling**:
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Increase the power of the existing database server by upgrading its hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.). While effective in the early stages, vertical scaling has its limits.
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute the database across multiple servers (sharding). As the user base grows, different portions of the database can be stored on different servers (e.g., by user ID, region, or group).

   #### b. **Database Sharding**:
   - Split the database into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards), each handling a subset of users or groups.
   - Sharding can be done based on:
     - User ID ranges.
     - Geographic regions (e.g., users in the US vs. users in Europe).
     - Group size (small groups vs. large groups).

   #### c. **Read-Replicas**:
   - Use **read replicas** to offload read-heavy operations from the primary database server.
   - Replicas can be used for tasks such as fetching user balances and retrieving group data, improving the response time for read queries.

   #### d. **Indexing**:
   - Optimize database queries by creating indexes on frequently queried fields such as:
     - User IDs.
     - Group IDs.
     - Expense timestamps.
   - This reduces query time as the database grows.

### 2. **Caching**

   - Implement caching to store frequently requested data (e.g., user balances) in memory, reducing the load on the database.
   - Use distributed caching systems like **Redis** or **Memcached** to store:
     - Frequently queried user balances.
     - Group information.
     - Recently added expenses.
   - This reduces the need for frequent database reads and improves response times, especially for high-traffic users or groups.

---

### 3. **Load Balancing**

   - Distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers using a **load balancer**.
   - This helps prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck by distributing traffic evenly across available resources.
   - Load balancers can handle requests for:
     - Adding expenses.
     - Retrieving user balances.
     - Group management operations.
   - Consider using tools like **NGINX** or **HAProxy** for efficient load balancing.

---

### 4. **Microservices Architecture**

   - As the system grows, consider breaking down the monolithic architecture into smaller, independent **microservices**.
   - Each microservice can handle a specific part of the system, such as:
     - User management.
     - Expense tracking.
     - Group management.
     - Notifications.
   - Microservices can be scaled independently based on the demand for each service.

---

### 5. **Message Queues for Asynchronous Processing**

   - For operations that don't need to happen in real time (e.g., sending notifications, simplifying debts), use **message queues** such as **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**.
   - Message queues allow tasks to be processed asynchronously, reducing the load on the main system and improving response times for users.

---

### 6. **CDN for Static Assets**

   - Use a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to serve static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - CDNs cache static files across multiple servers worldwide, reducing latency for users and lowering the load on the core application server.
   - This can improve the performance of the frontend, especially as user traffic increases globally.

---

### 7. **Eventual Consistency**

   - For certain parts of the system, like balance calculations, **eventual consistency** can be applied instead of strict real-time consistency.
   - This means that balances might not update instantly but will be consistent within a short time window, reducing the need for real-time processing and easing the load on the database.

---

### 8. **Auto-Scaling Infrastructure**

   - Use cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Azure**) with **auto-scaling** capabilities to automatically adjust the number of servers based on traffic and load.
   - Auto-scaling ensures that the system can handle traffic spikes efficiently without manual intervention, scaling up during peak times and scaling down during periods of low activity.
